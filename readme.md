I got Sarah's approval to build something different than the suggestions in [AI Coders Program: Application Project](https://fusionp2.wordpress.com/2025/12/17/ai-coders-program-application-project/).

Since I attended WordCamp Brazil at the end of November, the idea of creating something similar to [Random.org](https://www.random.org/) that could be added to WordPress posts and pages stuck in my mind.

I started creating the block on [Telex](https://telex.automattic.ai/) and improved its features with Cursor.

Cursor hallucinated a couple of times and added code that didn't work at first, but removing the code and adding a more descriptive prompt helped.

This didn't work as expected:

> Add feature XYZ

Something like this returned better results:

> Add an option for ABC called XYZ to section 123 to let the user set something.
